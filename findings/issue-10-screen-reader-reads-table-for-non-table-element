## Issue: Screen identifies an element as a "Table" when it is not a table.

### Description

On the Search Results page, the Search input is visually presented within a grid-like row layout. When focus enters the Search input, the screen reader announces “Table,” despite the content not being a data table and not supporting table navigation. This likely results from grid-based layout cues being interpreted as tabular structure.

### Impact

This may mislead screen reader users into thinking the Search input is part of a table, causing confusion and unnecessary cognitive load when navigating the page. E.g, It wrongly causes users to expect table keyboard navigation commands. This makes it harder for users to perform searches.

**Severity:** Medium
**Affected users:** Screen-reader users, keyboard-only users

### Suggested Remediation

1. Ensure grid layouts for form controls do not expose table semantics.
2. Prefer semantic grouping: <form> + <fieldset> + <legend>
    or a named region ("aria-labelledby")
    to help immedaite orientation and reduce cognitive dissonance when "Table" us read.
3. Avoid CSS table display values for layout.
4. Validate with NVDA / VoiceOver after changes.
