## Issue: Focus indicator on search input and search filters is difficult to perceive

## Description:**
The search input and the search filters receive keyboard focus, but the visual focus indicator is difficult to distinguish from surrounding UI elements. This makes it hard for keyboard users to determine when the input is focused.

**Impact:**
Keyboard-only users may lose track of focus location when navigating to the search input and the search filters, increasing the risk of errors or missed interactions.

**Severity:** Medium
**Affected users:** low-vision users and users in low-contrast viewing conditions; keyboard-only users

### Suggested Remediation
1. Increase color contrast between the focus indicator and the background image.
2. Increase the focus border size to 2.
