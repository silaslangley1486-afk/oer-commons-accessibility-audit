## Issue: Share button lacks accessible name due to misplaced aria-label

## Description:**
The Share button does not provide an accessible name to screen readers because its aria-label is applied to a non-interactive ancestor element rather than the button itself. As a result, assistive technologies fail to announce the purpose of the control.

This issue was initially identified via an axe DevTools scan and was manually validated by testing with a NVDA screen reader.

**WCAG 2.2:** 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
**Severity:** Medium
**Affected users:** screen reader users

### Suggested Remediation
Move the aria-label attribute directly onto the <button> element so that the control exposes a correct accessible name.
