## Issue: Share control lacks semantic button role, preventing screen readers from announcing its purpose

## Description:**
The Share control is implemented using a non-interactive <div> element with an aria-label but no semantic role. As a result, screen readers do not announce an accessible name for the control, making its purpose unclear to non-visual users.

This issue was initially identified via an axe DevTools scan and was manually validated by testing with a NVDA screen reader.

**WCAG 2.2:** 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
**Severity:** Medium
**Affected users:** screen reader users

### Suggested Remediation
Replace the non-semantic <div> with a native <button> element and remove the aria-label.
