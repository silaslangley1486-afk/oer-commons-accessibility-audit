## Methodology

Automated scanning using the axe DevTools browser extension was performed on representative pages.
Results were grouped by issue type, and representative instances were manually validated.
Repeated or low-impact findings were not individually documented.

Medium severity issues significantly affect usability or comprehension but do not fully block task completion.
